## Demo

<br>

## Getting started

This project is using Qwik with [QwikCity](https://qwik.builder.io/qwikcity/overview/). QwikCity is just a extra set of tools on top of Qwik to make it easier to build a full site, including directory-based routing, layouts, and more.

### Project structure

Inside **Qwikkin** template, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ adaptors/
|   â””â”€â”€ static/
|       â””â”€â”€ vite.config.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.json
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ robots.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/
|   |   â””â”€â”€ styles/
|   |       â””â”€â”€ global.css
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ atoms/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ icons/
|   |   â””â”€â”€ widgets/
|   |       â”œâ”€â”€ Hero.tsx
|   |       â”œâ”€â”€ Features.tsx
|   |       â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   |   â””â”€â”€ blog/
â”‚   |       â”œâ”€â”€ post-slug-1.md
â”‚   |       â”œâ”€â”€ post-slug-2.md
â”‚   |       â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routes/
â”‚   |   â”œâ”€â”€ blog/
â”‚   |   â”œâ”€â”€ index.tsx
|   |   â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx
|   |   â”œ-- service-worker.ts
â”‚   |   â””-- ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config.mjs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ entry.dev.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ entry.preview.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ entry.ssr.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ root.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

- `src/routes`: Provides the directory based routing, which can include a hierarchy of `layout.tsx` layout files, and an `index.tsx` file as the page. Additionally, `index.ts` files are endpoints. Please see the [routing docs](https://qwik.builder.io/qwikcity/routing/overview/) for more info.

- `src/components`: Recommended directory for components.

- `public`: Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the public directory. Please see the [Vite public directory](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#the-public-directory) for more info.

//To Do: Make a CodeSandbox if possible with KinodeOS

[![Edit Qwikkin on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://githubbox.com/onwidget/qwind/tree/main)

> **Seasoned qwik expert?** Delete this file. Update `config.mjs` and contents. Have fun!

<br>

//To Do: Add Yarn + Add Kinode Commands

### Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command            | Action                                         |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`      | Installs dependencies                          |
| `npm run dev`      | Starts local dev server at `127.0.0.1:5173/`   |
| `npm run build`    | Build your production site to `./dist/`        |
| `npm run preview`  | Preview your build locally, before deploying   |
| `npm run fmt`      | Format codes with Prettier                     |
| `npm run lint`     | Run Eslint                                     |
| `npm run qwik ...` | Run CLI commands like `qwik add`, `qwik build` |

<br>

### Configuration

//To Do: Define config properties

Basic configuration file: `./src/config.mjs`

```javascript
export const SITE = {
  name: "Example",

  origin: "https://example.com",
  basePathname: "/", // Change this if you need to deploy to Github Pages, for example
  trailingSlash: true, // Generate permalinks with or without "/" at the end
};
```

<br>

### Deploy

//TO DO: All Instructions

#### Deploy to Devlopment Enviorment 



#### Deploy KinodeOS Application



#### Deploy KinodeOS Node & Installing KinodeOS Application (via Kinode Vallet)



#### Deploy KinodeOS Node as Public Application Gateway (via AWS)

You can create an optimized production build with:

```shell
npm run build //TO DO
```

Now, your website is ready to be deployed. All generated files are located at
`dist` folder, which you can deploy the folder to any hosting service you
prefer.

## Roadmap

### Base

- [ ] Create utilities to generate permalinks tailored to the domain and base pathname.
- [ ] Create utilities to generate IPFS pinned Farcaster Frames tailored to context and user customizations.
- [ ] Create utilities to enable switching between media content's hosting location (Traditional Cloud  Vs. dStorage [IPFS/Storj] + dDistrobution [Crust Network])
- [ ] Create basic context system for referencing elements of content
- [ ] Create basic context system visualization
- [ ] Create component to enable building sharing frames and contextual frames via client
- [ ] Create configurable blog with categories, tags and authors using MDX
- [ ] Authentication via SIWE and Coinbase Smart Wallet
- [ ] Add more frequently used pages (About, Services, Contact, Docs ...)
- [ ] Inital ClientDB intergration
- [ ] Link previews, frame portal, and IPFS Gateway via hosted domain utilized for backwards compatiablity to resolve frames stored on IPFS without the link's frontend client requiring special handling (URL format: https://domain.example/frame-portal/:CID)
